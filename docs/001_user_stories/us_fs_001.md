# User Story: File System Overview and Synchronization Status

**Story ID:** US_FS_001

## Description
As a user, I want to open the application and get an overview of the file system and its synchronization status. This overview should provide both detailed information at the file and folder level, as well as aggregated statistics such as the total number of files and folders, and how many items are still unsynced.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The user can launch the application and view a dashboard or overview page.
- The overview displays:
	- A list of files and folders with their individual synchronization status.
	- Aggregated statistics, including:
		- Total number of files
		- Total number of folders
		- Number of unsynced files
		- Number of unsynced folders
- The information is updated in real-time or upon user request.
- The user can easily distinguish between synced and unsynced items.
