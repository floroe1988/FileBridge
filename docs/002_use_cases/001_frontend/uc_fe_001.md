**Case ID:** UC_FE_001

![Status: IMPLEMENTED](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-IMPLEMENTED-brightgreen)

## Description
The frontend shall display a section representing the file system. Each folder is shown as a collapsible item with its folder path as the name. Within each folder, all sub-folders and files are listed.

- Each folder and file has a button indicating its sync status:
	- Clickable if not synced
	- Grayed out and not clickable if synced
- The sync status is visually clear and updates appropriately.
