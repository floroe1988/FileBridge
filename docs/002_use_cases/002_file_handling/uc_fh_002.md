# Use Case: Data Structure for Aggregated Synchronization Information

**Case ID:** UC_FH_002

![Status: IMPLEMENTED](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-IMPLEMENTED-brightgreen)

## Description
Define and implement a data structure that holds and provides aggregated synchronization information about the file system to the frontend. This structure should efficiently calculate and store totals for folders, files, and unsynced items, making the data easily accessible for display.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A data structure is implemented to store aggregated sync information (total folders, total files, unsynced folders, unsynced files).
- The structure supports efficient updates and queries as the file system changes.
- Aggregated data is accessible to the frontend for display.
- The structure integrates with the overall file system data model.
