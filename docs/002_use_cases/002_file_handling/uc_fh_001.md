# Use Case: Data Structure for File System and Synchronization Status

**Case ID:** UC_FH_001

![Status: IMPLEMENTED](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-IMPLEMENTED-brightgreen)

## Description
Define and implement a data structure that represents the file system and tracks the synchronization status of each folder and file. The structure should support hierarchical relationships, store relevant metadata, and efficiently update and query sync status.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A data structure is implemented to represent the file system hierarchy (folders and files).
- Each folder and file in the structure includes metadata for sync status.
- The structure supports:
	- Efficient updates to sync status
	- Queries for aggregated sync information (e.g., total/unsynced files and folders)
- The structure integrates with the frontend and backend as needed.
